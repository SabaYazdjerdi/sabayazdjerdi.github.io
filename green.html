<p id="title">Remembering the Green Movement </p>
 <p> A new opposition was born after the disputed June 12, 2009, presidential election that <b> changed the face of Iranian politics and Iran. </b> The movement was widely seen as a new nonviolent, nonutopian, and populist paradigm of revolution that infused  twenty-first century Internet technology with people street power.
 Over the next six months, the Green Movement evolved from a  mass group of angry voters to a nationwide force demanding the  democratic rights originally sought in the 1979 revolution, rights that were hijacked by radical clerics.
